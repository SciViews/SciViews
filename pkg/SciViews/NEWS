== SciViews version 0.9-11

* path object is renamed filePath to avoid a clash with a path object in grid
  package. Related function path(), is.path(), as.path() are renamed accordingly
  filePath(), is.filePath() and as.filePath(). The print method is also adapted.
  
* warnAssignWithEqualSign, warnPartialMatchArgs, warnPartialMatchAttr and
  warnPartialMatchDollar in options() are now initialized to FALSE if they are
  not defined yet there.


== SciViews version 0.9-10

* Import from data.table is eliminated. For now, `@:=` is the same as `@<-`.

* Temporary objects are now saved in SciViews:TempEnv instead of TempEnv.


== SciViews version 0.9-9

* Improvements to activate warnings regarding possible R traps: if
  warnPartialMatchArgs, warnPartialMatchAttr, or warnPartialMatchDollar options
  are not defined yet, they are set to TRUE when the packages loads.
  
* For a similar purpose, we would like to avoid using = in place of <- for
  assignation. So, the "=" function is redefined to display a warning when it
  is used and when warnAssignWithEqualSign option is set to TRUE (by default).
  The warning message also suggests it may be == erroneously written =.

* Many functions are added with more coherent names for graphics.


== SciViews version 0.9-8

* Several changes in character.R.

* Added the rwg.colors() function.


== SciViews version 0.9-7

* Small corrections in man pages.

* Partial argument matching for all(.names) in names(). Fixed.


== SciViews version 0.9-6

* Added further (misc) functions.

* New syntax using x@attr for attributes, plus := for replacement by reference
  inspired from data.table package, which Sciviews now imports too.


== SciViews version 0.9-5

* Added functions to homogenize function names for strings and files
  manipulations.
  

== SciViews version 0.9-4

* The gamma argument in hsv() function disappears in R 2.14.0. As a consequence,
  the same gamma argument is dropped from rwb.colors(), ryg.colors() and
  cwm.colors().


== SciViews version 0.9-3

* A bug in svd.pca() subfunction of pcomp.default() was corrected.


== SciViews version 0.9-2

* Slight style refactoring of R code and man pages.


== SciViews version 0.9-1

* Added lb() function as a synonym of log2().


== SciViews version 0.9-0

This is the first version on R-forge. There used to be a SciViews **bundle**
that contained svMisc, svSocket, svGUI, ..., but bundles are obsolete now. The
new SciViews package plays a similar role as the bundle, i.e., it is a
convenient way to install all SciViews-R packages with one instruction:

> install.packages("SciViews", dependencies = TRUE).

It now plays also other roles:
(1) to load all SciViews requirements with a single instruction:

> require(SciViews)

(2) To make sure to reconfigure the socket server properly (that is, with the
same configuration as latest one), (3) To provides a series of R functions that
ease learning of R through the use of the R reference toolbox in Komodo Edit.
