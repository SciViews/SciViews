```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The `SciViews::R` dialect is base R + [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) + a series of SciViews packages like [data.io](https://www.sciviews.org/data.io/), [svFlow](https://www.sciviews.org/svFlow/), or [chart](https://www.sciviews.org/chart/) that makes a coherent and straightforward environment for data processing and visualization. In order to load all required packages, just use:

```{r}
SciViews::R()
```
