{SciViews} mainly provides the `SciViews::R` dialect through the function of the same name. It loads a series of tidyverse and SciViews packages in order to supplement base R with functions to implement that dialect. See, for instance the books [Science des Données Biologiques I](http://biodatascience-course.sciviews.org/sdd-umons/) and [Science des Données Biologiques II](http://biodatascience-course.sciviews.org/sdd-umons2/) (in French) for extensive examples of the use of `SciViews::R`.

## Installation

{SciViews} is available from CRAN, but it is an old version. You should install it from the [SciViews R-Universe](https://sciviews.r-universe.dev). To install this package and its dependencies, run the following command in R:

``` r
install.packages('SciViews', repos = c('https://sciviews.r-universe.dev',
  'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

An older version of {SciViews} can be installed from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("SciViews")
```

You can also install the latest development version. Make sure you have the {remotes} R package installed:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Use `install_github()` to install the {SciViews} package from GitHub (source from **main** branch will be recompiled on your machine):

``` r
remotes::install_github("SciViews/SciViews")
```

R should install all required dependencies automatically, and then it should compile and install {SciViews}.

## Further explore {SciViews}

You can get further help about this package this way: Make the {SciViews} package and all the other packages required by the `SciViews::R` dialect available in your R session:

``` r
SciViews::R()
```

Get help about this package:

``` r
library(help = "SciViews")
help("SciViews-package")
vignette("SciViews") # None is installed with install_github()
```
