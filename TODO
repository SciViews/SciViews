# SciViews To Do list

* Plot functions issue warnings for unknown arguments

* The vignette does not seem to be installed?!

* file_head()

* attrNames() or attr_names() like slotNames()

* unscale() to revert the effect of scale()?

* is.wholenumber()

* other xxx. functions for those using na.rm = FALSE like mean, median, sd, var,
  quantile, fivenum, ...

* Refine panel.xxx() functions to avoid warning in case we provide non-par
  arguments to pairs() and design a better mechanism to define default (colors,
  line type and weight, etc.).

* A better grid() for log scale, a grid() with intermediate lines (between two
  axis ticks), and a slightly different line for origin axes.

* A plot.htest() method that graphically shows the test results (needs specific
  representation for each test => how to do that?

* QQ-plot and statistical distributions plots.

* For PCA, look at ade4 (dudi.pca => c("pca", "dudi"), ellipse, area),
  FactoMineR (PCA), rrcov (Pca), pcaMethods (PcaRes), psych, nFactors, vegan
  rda = special case of pca => c("rda", "cca")), pcaPP, chemometrics
  (cross-validation), BiodiversityR (broken-stick = PCAsignificance + variable
  importance = ordiequilibriumCircle) and labdsv packages => how to sort all
  this and make something coherent with our pcomp object and methods?
  See also zoonek znd http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/factor.html.

* For correspondance analysis, see ca package.

* What about c.factor()??? C() applied to factor currently just produces
  rubbish... But, we may break existing code!

* unlist() should really be S3 generic with unlist.default + unlist.factor being
  the original unlist() function. Need also at least unlist.Date(),
  unlist.POSIXct() and unlist.POSIXlt(), although the first two treatments are
  already correct!

* unlist() applies to a list of matrices or arrays or data frames of the same
  shape, i.e., same objects types and same column names should really rbind()
  items... but using rbind() is inefficient => need another solution. Also, this
  should be called differently to unlist() to avoid breaking code, why not
  lbind()?

* Generic method bare(object) to drop all attributes except the one required to
  define a given object... perhaps onlyNames(object) that does the same as c(x),
  but see ?c.

* Translation of this package.
