Title: 'SciViews' - Data Processing and Visualization with the 'SciViews::R' Dialect
Description: The 'SciViews::R' dialect provides a set of functions that
  streamlines data input, process, analysis and visualization especially, but
  not exclusively, for beginners or occasional users. It mixes base R and
  tidyverse, plus another set of CRAN packages towards an easy and coherent user
  interface.
