Title: 'SciViews::R' Dialect for Data Processing and Visualization 
Description: The 'SciViews::R' dialect provides a set of functions that
  streamlines data input, process, analysis and visualization especially, but
  not exclusively, for beginners or occasional users. It mixes base R and
  tidyverse, plus another set of CRAN packages for an easy and coherent use of R.
